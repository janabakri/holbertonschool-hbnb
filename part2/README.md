# HBnB Project - Part 2: RESTful API Implementation

## Project Overview
HBnB is a simplified clone of Airbnb, developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum. This is Part 2 of the project, focusing on implementing a fully functional RESTful API that serves as the backend of the application.

The system manages users, property listings, reviews, and amenities while applying clean architecture principles and software design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Purpose
The API allows users to:

- **Manage Users**: Register, view, and update user profiles
- **List Properties**: Create and manage property listings
- **Write Reviews**: Rate and review properties
- **Add Amenities**: Define property features

This backend is designed to be easily extendable and ready for database integration in Part 3.

## Key Features
- Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- Input validation and structured error handling
- Password hashing for secure storage
- UUID-based unique identifiers
- Swagger documentation (auto-generated)
- Comprehensive test suite using pytest
- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Modular and scalable codebase

## System Architecture

The project follows a **Three-Layer Architecture**, ensuring proper separation between responsibilities.
