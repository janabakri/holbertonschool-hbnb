# HBnB Project - Part 2: RESTful API Implementation

## Project Overview
HBnB is a simplified clone of Airbnb, developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum. This is Part 2 of the project, focusing on implementing a fully functional RESTful API that serves as the backend of the application.

The system manages users, property listings, reviews, and amenities while applying clean architecture principles and software design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.
